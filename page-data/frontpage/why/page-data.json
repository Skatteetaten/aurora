Both Kubernetes and OpenShift lack support for groups of users that can adminster subsets of cluster objects. We have created a concept called <strong>affiliation</strong> to support this.</li>\n<li>The ability to deploy applications to <strong>several clusters</strong> in one command is highly desired within our organization. Our network infrastructure implies that we need to have multiple clusters.</li>\n<li>When configuring how to deploy applications and projects we want to avoid duplication. Our <strong>declarative</strong> config format AuroraConfig supports <strong>composition</strong> with <strong>sane defaults</strong>.</li>\n</ul>","headings":[{"value":"Why did you make things in-house?","depth":2}],"fields":{"slug":"/frontpage/why/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/frontpage/why/"}}}
