description: "Opinoinated way of configuring cloud applications"

Aurora Config is an opinoinated way of configuring how namespaces and applications are applied to an OpenShift cluster.

Config files are written either as Json or Yaml. All the examples will use YAML since it is easier on the eyes.

The process for parsing an AuroraConfig is as follows

* find relevant files
* extract and validate header
* extract DeploymentSpec

Extracting is done in a process where the paths from the below tables are matched against the available files. The most specific location is chosen.

### Dictionary

AuroraConfig: A set of files that share the same schemaVersion and affiliation. Files are either json or yaml.
LocalTemplate: An AuroraConfig can contain a templates folder with OpenShift template files.
Template: Other templates are referenced from the default namespace in your cluster.
ApplicationId: Indentify an Application. Contains the name of the application and an environment(affiliation and env name)
DeploymentSpec: Result of applying an ApplicationId to a given AuroraConfig

### Files

Given that you have an application with name 'reference' in the environment 'dev' the following files will be present

Note that the suffix of the file can be either json or yaml

| filename     | name   | reason                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| about.yaml   | global | All applications in a given AuroraConfig will inherit from it               |
| foo.yaml     | base   | All applications named 'reference' in all environments will inherit from it |
| dev.yaml     | env    | All applications in the env 'dev' inhert from it                            |
| dev/foo.yaml | app    | Instructons on how to deploy the application 'reference' in 'dev'           |

In order to generate an DeploymentSpec for a given ApplicationId files are read in the order specified above and merged together.
Information about what file contains what instruction is recorded so that it is possible to get a birds eye view over a DeploymentSpec and where the different instructions come from.

It is possible to change the base and env file in a given app file if you want to compose your configuration.

utv/reference.yaml

```yaml
baseFile: foo.yaml
envFile: about-template.yaml
```

In this scenario 'foo.yaml' would be used instead of 'reference.yaml' as the base file and the 'about-template.yaml' file would be used instead of 'about.yaml'

### Header

Some instructions are read as a header. This is done in order to provide sane defaults for the rest of the process.

Some of the header fields must be specified in an about file. The environment and permissions must be the same for all applications.

### Substitution

Some fields fromt header are available as substitutions when specifying the rest of the configuration

* affiliation
* cluster
* env
* name
* segment

In order to include these into a field surround them with '@'. An example

```
config/cluster : "@cluster@"
```

This will create a config value with the actual value of the cluster.

### Extracting DeploymentSpec

#### Generate application from Delivery Bundle

If you use the type deploy og development the application objects are generated using a Kotlin DSL from the following fields

| path                   | default     | description                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Generate application from template

If type is template or local template the application objects are generated by applying the template from the following fields.

| path             | default | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| template         |         | Name of template in default namespace to use. This is required if type is template                                            |
| templateFile     |         | Set the location of a local tempalte file. It should be in the templates subfolder. This is required if type is localTemplate |
| parameters/<KEY> |         | set value for a parameter in the template.                                                                                    |

NTA has the following technlogies that can be automated with the above fields

* Webseal is used for client trafic from within NTA to reach an application. Internal tax workers have roles that can be added to limit who can access the application
* STS certificate: An SSL certificate with a given commonName is used to identify applications to secure trafic between them
* Oracle Databases: We haven a DBH-api that expose functionality to auto provision a Oracle schema on a shared server. The API can also handle manual SQL connections for you so the application can get the crendentials in one way
* BigIP: In order for external consumer trafic to hit an application BigIP must be automated to send the trafic to the cluster.

#### Exposing an application via HTTP

The default behavior is that the application is only visible to other application in the same namespace using
its server name.

In order to control routes into the application the following fields can be used.

| path                                | default                    | description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| route                               | false                      | Toggle to expose application via HTTP. Routes can also be configured with expanded syntax. And routeDefault can be set for all routes. See below.  |
| route/<routename>/host              |                            | Set the host of a route according to the given pattern.                                                                                            |
| route/<routename>/path              |                            | Set to create a path based route. You should use the same name/affiliation/env/seperator combination for all path based routes to get the same URL |
| route/<routename>/annotations/<key> |                            | Set annotations for a given route. Note that you should use                                                                                        | instead of / in annotation keys. so 'haproxy.router.openshift.io | balance'. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#route-specific-annotations[route annotations] for some options. |
| routeDefaults/host                  | @name@-@affiliation@-@env@ | Set the host of a route according to the given pattern.                                                                                            |
| routeDefaults/path                  |                            | Set to create a path based route. You should use the same name/affiliation/env/seperator combination for all path based routes to get the same URL |
| routeDefaults/annotations/<key>     |                            | Set annotations for a given route. Note that you should use                                                                                        | instead of / in annotation keys. so 'haproxy.router.openshift.io | balance'. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#route-specific-annotations[route annotations] for some options. |

### Example configuration

#### Simple reference-application

Below is an example of how you could configure an instance of the [reference application](https://github.com/skatteetaten/openshift-reference-springboot-server)

about.yaml

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions :
  group : [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex : paas-test
```

reference.yaml

```yaml
groupId: no.skatteetaten.aurora.openshift
artifactId: openshift-reference-springboot-server
version: 1
replicas: 3
certificate: true
route: true
database: true
config:
  FOO: BAR
```

dev/about/reference.yaml

```yaml
cluster: dev
```

dev/about/reference.yaml

```yaml
config:
  FOO: BAZ
```

The complete config is then evaluated as

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions :
  group : [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex : paas-test
groupId: no.skatteetaten.aurora.openshift
artifactId: openshift-reference-springboot-server
version: 1
replicas: 3
certificate: true
route: true
database: true
config:
  FOO: BAZ
cluster: dev
```
