## What is Aurora Config?

TLDR; [Take me to the Configuration Reference!](#configuration-reference)

Aurora Config is a custom file based configuration format developed by the Norwegian Tax Administration designed to be a concise
representation of how applications are configured and deployed across environments and clusters in an OpenShift
based infrastructure. Parts of the configuration format is generally reusable by anybody deploying to OpenShift, while
other parts of it are designed to simplify integrations with specific third party components in our infrastructure.

The conciseness of the format is derived from a highly opinionated way of deploying applications to OpenShift,
providing override options only when necessary.

Config files are written either as Json or Yaml.

Aurora Config is structured around a four level file structure with the top level being the most general and the bottom
level, representing an application in a given environment, being the most specific - potentially overriding options set
at higher levels. Each environment has its own folder with a separate file for each application in that environment,
in addition to an about.yaml file describing the environment itself. The following table describes the different files;

| File             | Name in AC | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| about.yaml       | global     | The _global_ file is the most general file in an Aurora Config. All applications will inherit options set in this file, unless _globalFile_ is specifically set in the base or env file.                                                           |
| {app}.yaml       | base       | The _base_ file contains general configuration for all instances of application {app} across all environments. All instances will inherit options set in this file and will potentially override options set in the _global_ file.                 |
| {env}/about.yaml | env        | The _env_ file contains general configuration for all applications in environment {env}. All applications in the environment will inherit options set in this file and potentially override options set in both the _base_ file and _global_ file. |
| {env}/{app}.yaml | app        | The _app_ file contains specific configuration for application {app} in environment {env}. All options set in this file will potentially override options set in other files.                                                                      |

For the applications App1 and App2, and the environments test and prod, a typical Aurora Config could then look like;

    ├── about.yaml     (Configuration for all applications in all environments)
    ├── about-alternative.yaml (Alternative global configuration)
    ├── App1.yaml      (General configuration for App1)
    ├── App2.yaml      (General configuration for App2)
    ├── prod           (A folder named prod, representing the environment prod)
    │  ├── about.yaml  (Configuration for all applications in environment prod)
    │  ├── App1.yaml   (Configuration for App1 in environment prod)
    │  └── App2.yaml   (Configuration for App2 in environment prod)
    └── test           (A folder named test, representing the environment test)
       ├── about.yaml  (Configuration for all applications in environment test)
       ├── about-alternative.yaml  (Alternative Configuration for all applications in environment test)
       ├── App1.yaml   (Configuration for App1 in environment test)
       └── App2.yaml   (Configuration for App2 in environment test)

For a given _app_ file, it is possible to change the _base_ and _env_ file if you want to compose your configuration
differently than the default. For instance, you may need to deploy the same application in the same environment with
different name and configuration;

_File named 'test/App1Beta.yaml'_

```yaml
baseFile: App1.yaml
envFile: about-alternative.yaml
```

In this scenario 'App1.yaml' would be used instead of 'App1Beta.yaml' (which does not exist) as the base file for the
App1Beta in the environment test. The env file about-alternative will be used instead of the standard about file.
Note that env files must start with the prefix `about`

For a given env file, it is possible to include another env file that is read right before you using the configuration.

_In prod/about.yaml_

```yaml
includeEnvFile: test/about.yaml
```

In this scenario 'test/about.yaml' will be read right before 'prod/about.yaml'. This will make it possible to have an
environment that is a template for other environments.

_In App1.yaml_

```yaml
globalFile: about-alternative.yaml
```

In this scenario 'prod/App1.yaml' and 'test/App1.yaml' will inherit from 'about-alternative.yaml' at root level, replacing the default _global_ file. This makes it possible to have alternative global configurations for particular applications.

_In prod/about.yaml_

```yaml
globalFile: about-alternative.yaml
```

In this scenario 'prod/about.yaml' will inherit from 'about-alternative.yaml' at root level. This makes it possible to have alternative global configurations for entire environments.

## DeploymentSpec and ApplicationId

When the Aurora Config is processed a new object is generated for each _app_ file, representing the configuration
collected from the _global_ file, the _base_ file for that application, the _env_ file for the environment, and finally
the _app_ file itself. This object is called the DeploymentSpec for the given application. The identifier for a
DeploymentSpec, called ApplicationId, is the combination of environment name and application name. From the example
above we would get four DeploymentSpecs with the following ApplicationIds;

- prod/App1
- prod/App2
- test/App1
- test/App2

## Configuration Reference

The following sections will describe the different configuration options that are available in each of the files. The
examples will use the YAML format for the config files since it is terser and easier on the eyes than JSON.

### Header

Some options are considered header options and are read in a separate step during the configuration parsing process.
This allows us to set defaults and make available values in the header for variable substitution in the other
configuration options. In order to include these into a field surround them with '@', for instance.

```
config/cluster : "@cluster@"
```

Which options are available for substitution is indicated in the following tables.

Substitutions should be used with care especially if they occur in a file that applies to multiple application instances, e.g. env files and base files.

Some configuration options can only be set in the _global_ about file and the _env_ file. These are typically options that
are only relevant for configuring the environment, for instance environment name, permissions and env.ttl (time to live).
Since environments have their own folder and the environment is configured in an own about-file, it is not allowed for an
_app_-file to override any of the environment specific options. Options that can only be set in the _global_ file or in
an _env_ file will be described in a section called "About files" and options that can also be set in the _base_ files
and _app_ files will be describe in a section called "Application files".

### Notifications

Get notification messages when an application or environment/namespace has been deployed.

#### Mattermost

In order to use this feature
one has to use the channelId, which is not the same as the channel name. The channelId can be retrieved by going to a channel, then hitting view
info in the channel header. At the bottom of the dialog box you will find a greyed out channel id.

| path                                          | default | description                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notification/mattermost/<channelId>`         |         | Simplified config for enabling a mattermost notification for the given channelId. This requires a boolean. |
| `notification/mattermost/<channelId>/enabled` | true    | Set to false to disable notification for the given channel.                                                |

### Deployment Types

The configuration option `type` indicates the deployment type the application has. The value of this field affects
what other configuration options are available for that application. The deployment type determines primarily how
the objects that supports the application on OpenShift are generated, but it also affects the different types of
integrations that are supported.

#### deploy

The deploy deployment type is used for deploying applications using the conventions from the Aurora Platform. You can
read more about these conventions here: [How we Develop and Build our Applications](https://skatteetaten.github.io/aurora/documentation/openshift/#how-we-develop-and-build-our-applications).
This is the deployment type that will be most commonly used when deploying internally built applications. This will
provide integrations with the rest of the NTAs infrastructure and generate the necessary objects to OpenShift to support
the application.

#### development

The development deployment type is similar to the release deployment type but it will not deploy a prebuilt image and
instead create an OpenShift BuildConfig that can be used to build ad hoc images from DeliveryBundles from your local
development machine.

This will usually significantly reduce the time needed to get code from a development machine running on OpenShift
compared to, for instance, a CI/CD pipeline.

#### template

Supports deploying an application from a template available on the cluster. See [Guidelines for developing templates](#template_dev_guidelines).

#### localTemplate

Supports deploying an application from a template available in the AuroraConfig folder. See [Guidelines for developing templates](#template_dev_guidelines).

#### cronjob

Supports running a scheduled job as a CronJob resource on Kubernetes

#### job

Supports running a job as a Job resource on Kubernetes

Keys are normalized according to [XCU](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xbd/envvar.html). More specifically we replace "-. " with \_. If a key will be normalized there will be an warning emitted for that key. The value of the env vars is passed as is. Note: If you are using JSON string as the value of the config field, then all quotes in the json value must be escaped. See example below. |

Example specification of an json env var

```yaml
config:
  FOO: '{"BAR": "BAZ"}'
```

This will result in a json object with the key BAR and the value BAZ

### Configuration for job and cronjobs

For jobs and cronjobs you have to create an application that terminates when it is done and point to it using the normal groupId/artifactId:version semantics

| path                      | default              | description                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| groupId                   |                      | groupId for your application. Max 200 length. Required if deploy/development |
| artifactId                | \$fileName           | artifactId for your application. Max 50 length                               |

| liveness/path             |                      | Set to a path to do a GET request to that path as a liveness check           |
| liveness/port             | 8080                 | If no path present liveness will check if this port is open                  |
| liveness/delay            | 10                   | Number of seconds to wait before running liveness check                      |

| prometheus                | false                | Toggle to false if application do not have Prometheus metrics                |
| prometheus/path           | /actuator/prometheus | Change the path of where prometheus is exposed                               |
| prometheus/port           | 8081                 | Change the port of where prometheus is exposed                               |

#### Aditional configuration for cronjobs

| path              | default | description                                                                                                                            |

| suspend           | false   | Suspend/stop the job. Nb! See [suspend](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/#suspend) docs for caveats |

#### Supported integrations

Jobs and Cronjobs can have

- secrets
- databases
- STS tokens
- mounts

#### Limitations

Jobs and cronjobs do not support log aggregations and prometheus metrics at the moment. Use the script directive and do a
http call to a service alongside your job if you need this.

### Enable deployment on special nodes

Some deployments may require nodes with extended properties, such as larger available memory.
For the deployment to be able to deploy on special nodes they must be configured with `nodeProperties`.

| path                            | default | description                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nodeProperties/largeMem/enabled |         | Configures the deployment so it can be deployed on nodes with more available memory. |

Note: using nodeProperties should be in agreement with operations.

### Exposing an application via HTTP

The default behavior is that the application is only visible to other application in the same namespace using
its service name.

By using routes and CNAME entries, the application can be exposed in a cluster-independent way both on-premise and to Azure resources.

In order to control routes into the application the following fields can be used.

| path                                   | default                           | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

And routeDefault can be set for all routes. See below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If tls is used the host of the route cannot include the '.' key, since we do not support wildcard TLS cert.

Route annotations are usable for template types, but you need to create a Service with name after the NAME parameter yourself.

### Managing Secrets

In order to provide sensitive data to an application (i.e. passwords that cannot be stored directly in the configuration block of the AuroraConfig) it is possible to
access Vaults that has been created with the `ao vault` command (see internal link
https://wiki.sits.no/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=143517331#AO(AuroraOpenShiftCLI)-AOVault). You can access the vaults in two different ways; as a
_mount_ or via the _secretVault_ option.

If a Vault is accessed via the secretVault option and the vault contains a properties file the contents of that file will be made available as
environment variables for the application. Example;

```
PASSWORD=s3cr3t
ENCRYPTION_KEY=8cdca234-9a3b-11e8-9eb6-529269fb1459
```

If you want to mount additional Vaults or access vault files directly this can be done with mounting it as a volume. See the next section for more details.

| path                                | default           | description                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secretVaults/<svName>/name`        | \$svName          | Specify full secret vault that will be mounted under default secret location.          |
| `secretVaults/<svName>/enabled`     | true              | Set this to false to disable.                                                          |
| `secretVaults/<svName>/file`        | latest.properties | File in vault that will be used for fetching properties.                               |
| `secretVaults/<svName>/keys`        |                   | An array of keys from the latest.properties file in the vault you want to include.     |
| `secretVaults/<svName>/keyMappings` |                   | An map of key -> value that will rewrite the key in the secret to another ENV var name |

Note that it is possible to fetch multiple files from the same vault, the `svName` must be different for each one and you must set name to the same.

The old way of specifying secretVaults (detailed below is deprecated). There will be a migration feature soon. This configuration pattern only suppored
a single vault/file.

| path                    | default | description                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| secretVault             |         | Specify full secret vault that will be mounted under default secret location.          |
| secretVault/name        |         | Used instead of secretVault if you want advanced configuration                         |
| secretVault/keys        |         | An array of keys from the latest.properties file in the vault you want to include.     |
| secretVault/keyMappings |         | An map of key -> value that will rewrite the key in the secret to another ENV var name |

It is possible to use substitutions in keys/keyMappings but it should be used with care and doublechecked.

### Mounting volumes

| `mounts/<mountName>/enabled`     | true          | Set this to false to disable this mount                                                                                                             |
| `mounts/<mountName>/path`        |               | Path to the volume in the container. Required for each mount.                                                                                       |
| `mounts/<mountName>/mountName`   | `<mountName>` | Override the name of the mount in the container.                                                                                                    |
| `mounts/<mountName>/volumeName`  | `<mountName>` | Override the name of the volume in the DeploymentConfig.                                                                                            |
| `mounts/<mountName>/exist`       | false         | If this is set to true the existing resource must exist already.                                                                                    |
| `mounts/<mountName>/secretVault` |               | The name of the Vault to mount. This will mount the entire contents of the specified vault at the specified path. Type must be Secret, Exist false. |

The combination of type=PVC and exist=true is not supported by policy. We do not want normal java/web applications to use PVC mounts unnless strictly neccesary.

### NTA webseal integration

Webseal is used for client traffic from within NTA to reach an application. Internal tax workers have roles that can be added to limit who can access the application

| path                   | default | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| webseal                | false   | Toggle or assign an object to expose application through WebSeal.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| webseal/host           |         | Set the hostname of the WebSEAL route (domain varies by cluster). Default is `@name@-@affiliation@-@env@`                                                                                                                                                   |
| webseal/roles          |         | Set roles required to access this route. This can either be set as CSV or as an array of strings                                                                                                                                                            |
| webseal/strict         | true    | If the application relies on WebSEAL security it should not have an OpenShift Route, as clients may then be able to bypass the authorization. Strict will only generate warnings when both routes will be created. Set strict to false to disable warnings. |
| webseal/clusterTimeout |         | Set he timeout of the openshift route for this webseal junction. Should be valid durationString. Example 1s                                                                                                                                                 |

If you want to use webseal with a template type you need to create a Service with default ports named after the name parameter

### NTA STS integration

STS certificate: An SSL certificate with a given commonName is used to identify applications to secure traffic between them

For v1 of the STS service use:

| path                   | default | description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| certificate            | false   | Toggle to add a certificate with CommonName $groupId.$name. |
| certificate/commonName |         | Generate an STS certificate with the given commonName.      |

For v2 use:

| path   | default | description                                                 |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| sts    | false   | Toggle to add a certificate with CommonName $groupId.$name. |
| sts/cn |         | Generate an STS certificate with the given commonName.      |

### NTA Dbh integration

[dbh](https://github.com/skatteetaten/dbh) is a service that enables an application to ask for credentials to a database schema.

If there is no schema the default behavior is to create one.

It is possible to change the default values for this process so that each application that wants a database can just use the `database=true` instruction

| path                                   | default        | description                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If you want to change the default configuration for one application you need to use the expanded syntax

| path                                    | default                                | description                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `database/<name>/enabled`               | true                                   | Set to false to disable database                               |
| `database/<name>/flavor`                | \$databaseDefaults/flavor              | Override default flavor.                                       |
| `database/<name>/name`                  | <name>                                 | Override the name of the database.                             |
| `database/<name>/id`                    |                                        | Set the id of the database to get an exact match.              |

To share a database schema between multiple applications then one application must be defined as the owner of the schema.
The `<name>` must be the same in the configuration files, and for applications that do not own the schema `applicationLabel` must be set and match the name of the application owning the schema.

The `database` property configuration should not be put in global or env files.
For `databaseDefaults` should be used for database configuration for a whole or multiple environments.
configuration that should be the same for all applications in an environment should be set in
`databaseDefaults` placed in a global or env file.

### NTA S3 integration

To use the S3 integration, a bucket needs to exist before enabling s3 in auroraconfig.
Refer to internal documentation to see how a new bucket is created.

The config field objectArea(specified below) has the following acceptable pattern: lowercase characters, numbers, hyphen(-) and period(.).

It could be wise to set some defaults in your base configuration files. The s3Defaults are as follows:

| path                  | default | description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| s3Defaults/bucketName |         | Bucketname defined upon creation of s3 bucket. In order to use simplified config, this has to be defined                             |
| s3Defaults/objectArea |         | Objectarea is our read friendly abstraction for s3 objectprefix. In order to use simplified config, this has to be defined           |
| s3Defaults/tenant     |         | Tenant account where buckets are created, format: <affiliation>-<cluster>. In order to use simplified config, this has to be defined |

The simplified syntax is as follows:

| path | default | description                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s3   | false   | Simplified config that is dependant upon that s3Defaults/bucketName, s3Defaults/objectArea and s3Defaults/tenant is set |

For expanded syntax the following applies:

| path                         | default | description                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s3/<objectArea>/enabled`    | true    | Enabled lets you disable s3 for that specific objectArea. |
| `s3/<objectArea>/bucketName` |         | Set the bucketName for that specific objectArea.          |
| `s3/<objectArea>/objectArea` |         | Overrides the objectArea set in <objectArea>              |
| `s3/<objectArea>/tenant`     |         | Overrides the Tenant set in <tenant>                      |

### Registration of alerts

Application specific alerts can be automatically registered by adding the following configuration.

| path                             | default                              | description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alerts/<alertName>/enabled`     | false                                | Enabled lets you enable the specified alert                                                                   |
| `alerts/<alertName>/expr`        |                                      | Set the promql expression that should trigger an alert                                                        |
| `alerts/<alertName>/delay`       |                                      | Time in minutes until a condition should cause Prometheus to send alert to alert-manager                      |
| `alerts/<alertName>/connections` |                                      | Array of connection rules between alert definition and recipients via specific channels                       |
| `alerts/<alertName>/severity`    |                                      | Severity of alert that is registered, values: critical, warning                                               |
| `alerts/<alertName>/summary`     | oppsummering av alarm er ikke angitt | Clear text summary of what the alert does                                                                     |
| `alerts/<alertName>/description` | beskrivelse av alarm er ikke angitt  | Clear text description of the alert                                                                           |

Some configuration values can be set with defaults, these values will be used unless an alert-configuration overrides it.
`alertsDefaults` can be set in the _base_ file if they should be used for all instances of an application across all environments,
or in the _env_ file if they should be used for all applications in that environment.

| path                         | default | desctiption                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alertsDefaults/enabled`     | false   | Enabled lets you enable the specified alert                                                                   |
| `alertsDefaults/connections` |         | Array of connection rules between alert definition and recipients via specific channels                       |
| `alertsDefaults/delay`       |         | Time in minutes until a condition should cause Prometheus to send alert to alert-manager                      |

### Logging configuration

To configure logging it is necessary to add the logging configuration block to the aurora config.
If the configuration is not specified then the application(s) will log via Splunk Connect to a default index `log-ocp-<env>`.

**Note**: Log files are expected to reside under `/u01/logs`

#### Simple configuration

A minimal configuration specifying the log index can be added to the configuration.

```yaml
logging: # configuration block
  index: myapp-index # splunk index where logs will be indexed
```

#### Separate indexes

It is possible to define separate splunk indexes for different types of logs.
Logs that are not specified explicitly will be indexed to the index specified in `logging.index`.

Available defined log types:

| Name        | Type            | Log file pattern |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| access      | access_combined | \*.access        |
| application | log4j           | \*.log           |
| audit_json  | \_json          | \*.audit.json    |
| audit_text  | log4j           | \*.audit.text    |
| gc          | gc_log          | \*.gc            |
| sensitive   | log4j           | \*.sensitive     |
| slow        | log4j           | \*.slow          |
| stacktrace  | log4j           | \*.stacktrace    |

To configure a specific, of the available log types, then `logging.loggers.<logname>` must be configured (replace `<logname>` with one of the log type names).

```yaml
logging:
  index: myapp-index # splunk index where log will be indexed
  loggers:
    stacktrace: myapp-stacktrace-index # splunk index where stacktraces will be indexed
    audit_text: aud-myapp-index # splunk index where audit_text logs will be indexed
```

#### Separate indexes with custom file pattern

We have support for specifying custom file patterns if you do not follow the default patterns. We strongly advice you to use the default loggers config if possible.
We do not allow custom sourcetypes, we currently support [_json, access_combined, gc_log, log4j].
If you need support for another sourcetype you need to contact us.
When you use custom logging, you take full ownership and responsibility of capturing logs with correct file pattern.
If you specify custom logging you cannot have the config fields `logging/index` or `logging/loggers`.
For custom logging you have to specify one logger that is named application, see example below.

Custom logging:

```yaml
logging:
  custom:
    application:
      index: openshift
      sourcetype: log4j
      pattern: "*-custom-app.log"
    custom-access:
      index: openshift
      sourcetype: access_combined
      pattern: "*-custom-aud.log"
```

#### Configurable fields

By default, descriptive fields will be added to the messages logged by the application. It is possible to toggle these fields on or off.

| Name                       | Default | Description                          |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| logging/fields/environment | true    | Add field environment to log message |
| logging/fields/version     | true    | Add field version to log message     |
| logging/fields/nodetype    | true    | Add field nodetype to log message    |
| logging/fields/application | true    | Add field application to log message |
| logging/fields/cluster     | true    | Add field cluster to log message     |
| logging/fields/nodename    | false   | Add field nodeName to log message    |

#### Add fluent-bit sidecar container for additional types

Fluent-bit is only supported for types: [deploy, development], however it is possible to opt-in for the types [localTemplate, template, job, cronJob].
You are not guaranteed that it will work for all types and your specific use case. You might have to configure custom logging
if the logfiles do not conform to the normal filenames.

```yaml
logging:
  index: "openshift"
  enableForAdditionalTypes:
    localTemplate: true
    template: true
    job: true
    cronjob: true
```

#### Disable fluent-bit sidecar logging

Setting `logging.index` to an empty value will prevent the application from running with a logging sidecar.
This can be useful in situations where a fluent-bit sidecar is unwanted, for example a job that may hang if the pod starts with a fluent-bit container.

```yaml
logging:
  index: ""
```

### Topology

Support for organizing the [OpenShift topology view](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/applications/odc-viewing-application-composition-using-topology-view.html)
is available with the `topology` configuration.

| Name                  | Default | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `topology/partOf`     |         | Used to group deployments visually.                                     |
| `topology/runtime`    |         | Single value defining the runtime (i.e spring-boot) of the application. |
| `topology/connectsTo` |         | List of application names the deployment connects to.                   |

Notes:

- All fields are optional.
- `partOf` can only hold one value.
- For which values to use in `connectsTo` see the description for `name` in [Application files](#application-files).

The `partOf` property is only used for visual grouping of deployments,
Each project decide themselves how to use the visual grouping, and there are no pre-defined values.

The `runtime` property is used to select a display icon. For example when `topology/runtime=spring-boot` is set, the topology view will show a spring-boot icon.
Supported icons are listed in the logos array in the link below (it is not necessary to include the `icon-` part of the name):

- https://github.com/openshift/console/blob/master/frontend/public/components/catalog/catalog-item-icon.tsx
- Alternatively supported icons can be found by right-click on the topology view and `Add to project` -> `Container image` and check the `Runtime icon` dropdown list.

The `connectsTo` property indicate which applications the deployment connects to in one direction (sends requests to).
The topology view can only visualize connections in the same namespace.

The topology configuration will add the following labels and annotations to the deployment

- `topology/partOf` adds the label `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=<config-value>` on all resources belonging to the deployment.
- `topology/runtime` adds the label `app.kubernetes.io/runtime=<config-value>` on all resources belonging to the deployment.
- `topology/connectsTo` adds the annotation `app.openshift.io/connects-to=['config-value']` on the DeploymentConfig.

### Configure Maskinporten

| Name                           | Default         | Description                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `maskinporten`                 |                 | Simplified configuration can be used to enabled/disable the feature                                |
| `maskinporten/enabled`         |                 | Enable or disable maskinporten                                                                     |
| `maskinporten/<name>/enabled`  |                 | Required boolean value. Set to true to mount secret for Maskinporten client with provided clientID |
| `maskinporten/<name>/clientId` | value from name | The value from name is used by default, this field can be used to override the clientId            |

Note: If maskinporten feature is disabled with simplified configuration or `maskinporten/enabled` then it must be explicitly re-enabled.

## Example configuration

### Simple reference-application

Below is an example of how you could configure an instance of the [reference application](https://github.com/skatteetaten/openshift-reference-springboot-server)

about.yaml

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions:
  group: [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex: paas-test
```

reference.yaml

```yaml
groupId: no.skatteetaten.aurora.openshift
artifactId: openshift-reference-springboot-server
version: 1
type: deploy
replicas: 3
certificate: true
route: true
database: true
config:
  FOO: BAR
```

dev/about.yaml

```yaml
cluster: dev
```

dev/reference.yaml

```yaml
config:
  FOO: BAZ
```

The complete config is then evaluated as

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions:
  group: [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex: paas-test
groupId: no.skatteetaten.aurora.openshift
artifactId: openshift-reference-springboot-server
version: 1
type: deploy
replicas: 3
certificate: true
route: true
database: true
config:
  FOO: BAZ
cluster: dev
```

### Applying template with NTA integrations

about.yaml

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions:
  group: [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex: paas-test
```

sample-atomhopper.yaml

```yaml
type: template
template: aurora-atomhopper-1.0.0
databaseDefaults:
  flavor: POSTGRES_MANAGED
database: true
route: true
parameters:
  FEED_NAME: feed
  DB_NAME: atomhopper
  DOMAIN_NAME: localhost
```

dev/about.yaml

```yaml
cluster: dev
```

dev/sample-atomhopper.yaml

empty file

The complete config is then evaluated as

```yaml
schemaVersion: v1
affiliation: paas
permissions:
  group: [PAAS_OPS, PAAS_DEV]
splunkIndex: paas-test
type: template
template: aurora-atomhopper-1.0.0
databaseDefaults:
  flavor: POSTGRES_MANAGED
database: true
route: true
parameters:
  FEED_NAME: feed
  DB_NAME: atomhopper
  DOMAIN_NAME: localhost
```

### Example configuration for alerts

Single application _utv/sample-app.yaml_

```yaml

---
alerts:
  failed-connections:
    enabled: true
    delay: "2"
    connections:
      - "aurora"
    expr: "failed_connections > 5"
    severity: "critical"
    summary: "Connections has failed over 5 times"
    description: "Instance has had over 5 connection failures"
  duplicate-entries:
    enabled: true
    delay: "5"
    connections:
      - "aurora"
    expr: "duplicate_entries > 10"
    severity: "warning"
    summary: "Duplicate entries has been registered over 10 times"
    Description: "Application has registered over 10 duplicates"
```

Default alert configuration with override
_sample-app.yaml_

```yaml
---
alertsDefaults:
  enabled: true
  delay: "5"
  connections:
    - "aurora"
```

_utv/sample-app.yaml_

```yaml
baseFile: "sample-app.yaml"

alerts:
  failed-connections:
    delay: "1"
    expr: "failed_connections > 5"
    severity: "critical"
    summary: "Connections has failed over 5 times"
    description: "Instance has had over 5 connection failures"
  duplicate-entries:
    expr: "duplicate_entries > 10"
    severity: "warning"
    summary: "Duplicate entries has been registered over 10 times"
    Description: "Application has registered over 10 duplicates"
```

## Guidelines for developing templates

When creating templates the following guidelines should be followed:
